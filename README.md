# vagranttest
A simple test of load balancing using vagrant

My Vagrant environment was out of date and I needed to install the latest version and update the VirtualBox plugins using 'vagrant plugin update'
The centos/7 box was then added using 'vagrant box add centos/7' and selecting the VirtualBox provider.
